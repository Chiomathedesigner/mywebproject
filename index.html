            <h3> Some Random Text</h3>
           <span>
             <p>This is a practise text and i just need to have some random text in here for use. i know i can literally use lorem ipsum but i am deciding not to but instead type random things from the top of my head. Do you know, i am really excited on this web development journey, to be honest, the motivation is not there but this is a challenge to myself and i promise myself not to give up so soon. i want to look in the next 9months, give myself a hug and be proud that i did not give up. Did i forget to mention that i have a sponsor too...lol. my sponsor is too kind, although emotionally absent, which i hate so much but i am sure he wants the best for me and my future. i want to make him proud too and ensure his sacrifice does not go to waste. okkkkkkk! lets talk about what i will do with my first earning as a developer....i will go on a vacation, definetly, i super so look forward to that day and yes, i will be taking my sponsor along. All expense paid trip by yours truly: ME. hahaha! I will be called the odogwu spender, lol.....i am such a waist. Lets end this here for now. Byia! Ciao.</p><br>
